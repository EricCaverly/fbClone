# FB Clone 
Totally not official Fl\*ppy B\*rd clone (please don't sue me)

This project was created so that I could practice using raylib and C++. It is not indended to be sold or become something great.

## Building
- You must obtain the raylib library yourself. CMake should automatically find it once installed to your system.
- Afterwards it's a standard build procedure

```bash
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make
```

To run the game
```bash
./fb
```
